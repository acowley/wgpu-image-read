#+title: Two Approaches to Initializing a Texture with =wgpu=

Usage:

#+begin_src bash
RUST_LOG=image_read=info cargo run images/input-file.jpeg
#+end_src

The test program loads an image file and copies its contents to a ~wgpu::Texture~ two different ways, and then reads back the texture data to see if it survived the round trip.

On Linux with an AMD GPU and =wgpu='s Vulkan backend, the round trip fails if I create a ~wgpu::Buffer~ initialized with the image data, then copy that to a texture with ~wgpu::CommandEncoder::copy_buffer_to_texture~. The round trip succeeds if I only create the texture and use ~wgpu::Queue::write_texture~ to initialize it.
